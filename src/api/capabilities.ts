 * to a version number.
 *
 * Contract (documented in website/api/system.md → "GET /api/v1/capabilities"):
 *   - keys are additive-only and never change meaning; dropping a feature means
 *     dropping its key, not flipping its value,
 *   - a missing key means "unsupported", and a 404 on the endpoint itself means
 *     the gateway predates capability discovery and supports none of these.
 *
 * Add a new capability here (plus its website/api/system.md entry); never inline a feature list
 * in a route handler.

 * Channels whose sessions accept a message injected by another client via

 * injected text is delivered into the channel conversation and echoed back to
 * the channel's users. Values are the gateway's own channel identifiers
 * ({@link ChatChannel}), the same strings a session reports as its channel.
 *
 * The web→channel echo (runner.ts `writeAutoForward`, reached from
 * `sendMessageToSession`/`sendOrchestratedChannel`) has a delivery branch for
 * every {@link CHAT_CHANNELS} member and, since the echo's telegram-only guard
 * was removed (#539, "echo web channel messages back to the originating
 * channel (all channels)"), fires for every channel — so this manifest lists
 * all of them. Deriving from CHAT_CHANNELS keeps it in lockstep: a new channel
 * added there (which must also gain a `writeAutoForward` branch) is advertised
 * automatically, and nothing here can drift out of the canonical union.
