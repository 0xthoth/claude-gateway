 * boolean by the caller. Flags not in this set keep the default heuristic
 * (consume the next token unless it looks like another flag).
 *
 * A declared boolean flag's `--flag=value` form is parsed as a boolean too
 * (`value !== 'false'`), not left as a raw string — otherwise `--force=true`
 * silently reads as truthy-but-not-`true`, and a strict `flags.force === true`
 * check downstream (as `service install` does) refuses despite the explicit
