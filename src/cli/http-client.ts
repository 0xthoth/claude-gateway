 * local gateway wins; `--url` and `$CLAUDE_GATEWAY_URL` still override, for
 * deliberately exercising the proxy path or reaching another host.
 *
 * Liveness comes from a pidfile, which can lie: a gateway killed without
 * cleanup leaves one behind, and the OS may reissue that pid to an unrelated
 * process. The local address would then be preferred and nothing would answer
 * it, so `publicUrl` is returned as `fallbackUrl` — the same gateway by its
 * other name — for the caller to retry once. That cost is paid only when the
 * local address is genuinely unreachable.
 *
 * A bind of 0.0.0.0 / :: is a listen address, not a dial address, so it is
