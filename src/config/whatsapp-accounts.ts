/**
 * WhatsApp multi-account config shape — normalization, back-compat upgrade,
 * and the on-disk state-directory rule.
 *
 * Phase 1 of the WhatsApp feature-parity plan replaced `AgentConfig.whatsapp`'s
 * single flat block:
 *
 *   "whatsapp": { "dmPolicy": "allowlist", "dmAllowlist": ["…"] }
 *
 * with an array of per-number accounts:
 *
 *   "whatsapp": { "accounts": [ { "id": "default", "dmPolicy": "allowlist", … } ] }
 *
 * A gateway upgraded in place will have live config.json files (and a LIVE
 * linked Baileys session on disk) in the old shape, so:
 *
 *  1. {@link upgradeAgentWhatsAppAccounts} rewrites the old shape into the new
 *     one in memory, and {@link upgradeWhatsAppAccountsFile} writes it back so
 *     the config self-heals permanently on first load.
 *  2. The synthesized account is always `id: 'default'`, and 'default' is
 *     special-cased in {@link whatsAppStateDir} to keep using the historical
 *     BARE `<workspace>/.whatsapp-state/` directory. Nothing on disk moves, so
 *     an already-linked number stays linked across the upgrade. Only NEW
 *     accounts get a `<workspace>/.whatsapp-state/<id>/` subdirectory.
