Generate workspace markdown files for this agent. Output each file as:

=== AGENTS.md ===
<content here>

=== SOUL.md ===
<content here>

Rules:
- AGENTS.md is REQUIRED. Start with "# Agent: ${name}" on line 1.
  Include: role, rules, what it can/cannot do, language to use.
  Always include these rules under ## Rules:
  "Report completion (mandatory): After finishing any task, ALWAYS send a reply summarising what
   was done before the session ends. Never silently complete work without reporting the result back
   to the user."
  Also include an "## Emoji Usage" section in AGENTS.md with these guidelines:
    - React to messages naturally — use the react tool. Max 1 reaction per message.
    - Signature emoji: ${options?.signatureEmoji ? `Use ${options.signatureEmoji} as your signature emoji in greetings or sign-offs.` : 'None assigned.'}${signatureNote}
- IDENTITY.md (optional): agent name, emoji, avatar, creature, vibe. Omit if not needed.
- SOUL.md: tone and personality only (not rules). Omit if no distinct style.
- USER.md: target user profile. Omit if public/unknown.
- HEARTBEAT.md: only if proactive/scheduled tasks were described. Use YAML tasks format.
- Keep each file under 500 words.
- Omit files that are not relevant.
- IMPORTANT: On the very FIRST line of your output (before any === markers), output a single emoji that best represents this agent's personality or role. Just the emoji alone on line 1, nothing else.`;

Update this agent.md to follow current best practices:
- Preserve the agent's role, purpose, and all existing rules
- REMOVE any "Acknowledge first" rule if present — this is now handled at infrastructure level
- Ensure ## Rules section includes this rule (add if missing, strengthen if weak):
  "Report completion (mandatory): After finishing any task, ALWAYS send a reply summarising what
   was done before the session ends. Never silently complete work without reporting the result back
   to the user."
- Ensure an "## Emoji Usage" section exists with these guidelines:
    - React to messages naturally — use the react tool. Max 1 reaction per message.
    - Signature emoji: preserve any existing signature emoji setting.
- Remove any mention of "emojiReactionMode" if present
- Keep the file under 500 words

Output ONLY the updated agent.md content — no preamble, no explanation, no commentary.
Start directly with the first line of the agent.md content.`;
