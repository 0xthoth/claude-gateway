/**
 * Regression guard for #479 — `npm test`'s `pretest` hook forced a full,
 * non-incremental `tsc` build on every invocation, pushing this 8GB shared
 * host to ~95% RAM with swap saturated (peak RSS occurred during the
 * `pretest` -> `tsc` step, not during the Jest run itself).
 *
 * `pretest`/`pretest:unit` still build before tests run — several `mcp/tools/**`
 * modules under test (`mcp/tools/telegram/typing.ts`, `whatsapp-cloud/module.ts`,
 * `slack/module.ts`, `skills/handlers.ts`) contain real (non-mocked) TypeScript
 * imports from `dist/**`, so ts-jest genuinely needs `dist/` built to resolve
 * them — a `jest.mock(path, factory, { virtual: true })` only substitutes the
 * module at runtime, it does not stop ts-jest's TypeScript compiler from
 * resolving the import statement at compile time (confirmed by running
 * `test:unit` against a checkout with no `dist/`: TS2307 "Cannot find module"
 * on those four files). Skipping the build for `test:unit` alone would break
 * it on any fresh checkout and in `release.yml`, which runs `npm run test:unit`
 * before its separate `Build` step.
 *
 * The actual fix is the `incremental: true` + `tsBuildInfoFile` cache below:
 * the first build after a fresh checkout still pays full cost, but every
 * repeat `tsc` invocation on the same checkout (`pretest`, `pretest:unit`,
 * `typecheck`) reuses the cached type info instead of recompiling `src/`
 * from scratch — which is the case that actually matters on this host,
 * where the same checkout runs tests repeatedly across a session.
