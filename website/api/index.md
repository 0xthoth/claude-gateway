# HTTP API reference {#http-api-reference}

This reference documents the gateway API, including orchestration, tasks and voice. Start with [endpoint and authorization tables](/api/overview), then use the detailed request fields, response schemas, errors and examples for each family below.

## Authentication and public paths {#authentication-and-public-paths}

Configure API keys in `gateway.api.keys` in `config.json`. Send `X-Api-Key: <key>` or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. The API returns `401` for a missing key and `403` for an invalid key. Agent access is checked separately; `agents: "*"` grants all-agent scope, `write: true` allows scoped writes, and `admin: true` allows administrative operations. See [key configuration examples](/api/agents#setup).

Public and cookie/ticket-authenticated exceptions are identified in the [overview](/api/overview): health checks, provider-verified webhooks, capability share URLs, the dashboard, the paired terminal and OAuth callbacks have their own access rules. Monitoring requires admin access when keys are configured and fails closed on non-loopback keyless binds.

Use `http://127.0.0.1:10850` for a local gateway or your configured gateway origin. API routers are mounted under `/api`, so router-local `/v1/...` paths (including route-manifest entries) become public `/api/v1/...` URLs. Root paths such as `/health`, `/dashboard`, `/webhooks/...`, `/shared/...` and `/oauth/mcp/callback` do not take this prefix. No real credentials are included in these examples: replace example values with your own configured keys and identifiers.

```bash
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:10850/api/v1/agents \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $CLAUDE_GATEWAY_API_KEY"
```
